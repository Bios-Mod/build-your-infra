# Contributing to multi-lab

This lab is designed as a modular, community-usable reference. Contributions that improve clarity, correctness, or coverage are welcome.

## How to contribute

**Reporting issues**
Open a GitHub Issue describing:
- Which module, environment, or config file is affected
- What the current behaviour is and what you expected
- Your deployment context (`local`, `vps`, or `aws-native`) and architecture (ARM64 or x86_64)

**Suggesting improvements**
Open a GitHub Issue before submitting a PR for significant changes — a brief discussion avoids duplicated effort and keeps the lab coherent.

**Submitting a pull request**
1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Keep changes focused — one fix or addition per PR
3. Follow the existing conventions:
   - Config files in `modules/<module>/self-managed/configs/` include a standard header block:
     ```
     # Deploy to:  <absolute target path on server>
     # Reload:     <reload/restart command>
     # Module:     <module name>
     # Requires:   <prior module if applicable> / none
     #
     # <one-line description>
     # Parameters modified from baseline:  <param → new value> / none
     ```
   - Doc sections follow the `What was done / Why / Verification` structure
   - Commands are copy-pasteable and tested
   - Inline comments explain *why*, not just *what*
4. If adding a new service module, open an Issue first to align on scope

## What is in scope

- Corrections to existing steps (commands, paths, parameter values)
- Clarifications to existing documentation
- Additional verification commands for existing steps
- Platform-specific notes (provider differences, alternative architectures)
- AWS Native equivalents or corrections for existing modules

## What is out of scope

- New service modules (open an Issue first to align on scope)
- Automation content under `automation/` (planned for a future phase)
- GUI-based tools or non-CLI approaches

## Code of conduct

Be direct and technical. Criticism of the work is welcome; criticism of the person is not.
